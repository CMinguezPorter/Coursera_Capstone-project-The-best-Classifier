# Coursera_Capstone-Project: The best classifier
This project is a practice aplying the knowledge adquired in the course "Introduction to Machine Learning - IBM", where I learned about different types of regression and classification algorithms. 

In this case, the project is focused on classification algorithms, such as k-NN, Decision Trees, SVM and Logistic Regression. 

The dataset used in this project is from the IBM cloud. This dataset is about past loans and the data set includes details of 346 customers whose loan are already paid off or defaulted.
